# Core Principles of Programming: A Learning Blueprint

Master the fundamentals of programming using flowcharts, pseudocode, and the power of AI assistance.  Each lesson combines conceptual learning with guided queries to Gemini/ChatGPT, ensuring a  language-agnostic approach and reinforcing concepts through real-world examples.

**Key Conceptual Points**

- **Focus on Fundamentals**: This approach prioritises a deep understanding of core programming concepts for long-term success.

- **Adaptable Mindset**: You'll develop a flexible problem-solving mindset applicable to various programming languages.

- **Procedural Mastery**: We'll establish a strong foundation in procedural programming before progressing to object-oriented and functional paradigms.

- **Visual Learning**: Learning will centre on flow diagrams and pseudo-code for clear logic visualisation.

- **Language Examples**: Practical demonstrations in Python and Java will illustrate concepts.

**Key Technical Points**

- **Interactive Learning**: Content generation will be supported by ChatGPT or Gemini, with my guidance on targeted questions.

- **Independent Exploration**: Each topic requires self-driven research and expansion for deeper understanding.

- **Progress Checks**: Chapters will integrate exercises, examples, and quizzes to reinforce your knowledge.

**How to use this guide:**

1. **Open ChatGPT/Gemini**. I would suggest both as they might provide different points of view for the same concept 

2. **For each chapter**

   1. Ask the suggested questions to ChatGPT/Gemini;

   2. Read careful the content;

   3. Ask for explanation if something is not clear;

   4. Stop and reflect on what’s just read;

   5. Move to the next suggested question;

   6. _\[Repeat from point i. to v. till you finish the suggested questions]_

   7. Do a self assessment using the “Knowledge check” section;

   8. If che chapter has an exercise section, do the suggested exercises and check the results asking ChatGPT/Gemini;

   9. If you can clearly reply to the self assessment questions and have no doubt on the exercise results, move to the next chapter. If not, start from the point you are less confident about;

3. **Explore on your own**, is there any aspect you are more intrigued about, do more research. Always ask why and how?
