# Numeral systems and Boolean logic

This chapter lays the foundation for understanding how computers work at their most basic level. We'll cover numeral systems and Boolean logic – the building blocks of software instructions.


## Gemini/ChatGPT Queries

- What are numeral systems?

- Why are numeral systems relevant for a software developer? 

- Let’s dig into the binary system, and why it is important in computer science.

- What are logic gates and how do they work? 

- Why are logic gates important to understand for developers?

- Let’s dig into the boolean logic. Provide examples for the main operations.


## Exercise

Convert the binary `0b01011010` into decimal format

Convert the decimal `6749` into Hex format 

Perform `0b11001010` `AND` `0b01101101`

Perform `0b10111001` `XOR` `0b01000101`

Combine AND and OR to extract bits 3 and 4 (zero-indexed) from the binary number `0b1100101`?
